# Fitness

Welcome to Fitness! This repository contains the source code for the Fitness platform, divided into a NestJS backend and an Expo React Native frontend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### 🔙 Backend (NestJS)

Located in the `backend` directory.

1.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    Make sure to create a `.env` file based on `example.env` if required (or ensure your environment variables are set).

4.  **Run the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend runs on `http://localhost:3000` (default NestJS port) or the port specified in your env.

### 📱 Frontend (Expo React Native)

Located in the `frontend` directory.

1.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will start the Expo development server. You can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone or press `a` for Android Emulator / `i` for iOS Simulator.
